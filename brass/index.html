                    <h3>What is the trumpet?</h3>
                    <p>The trumpet is a brass musical instrument with a flared bell and three piston valves. It is one of the highest-pitched 
                        instruments in the brass family and is often used in orchestras, jazz bands, and various other musical genres. 
                        The trumpet has been around for centuries and has a long history of use in many different cultures around the world. 
                        It is played by blowing air through a cup-shaped mouthpiece while pressing down on the valves to change the pitch of 
                        the notes. The trumpet is known for its bright, piercing sound that can cut through even the loudest of musical ensembles.</p>

                    <h3>What is the trombone?</h3>
                    <p>The trombone is a brass musical instrument that features a long, cylindrical tube with a flared bell and a sliding U-shaped
                         tube that serves as a valve mechanism. The trombone is unique among brass instruments in that its pitch is changed by 
                         extending or retracting the slide rather than by pressing valves or keys. This allows the trombone to produce a continuous
                          range of pitches and glissandi, giving it a distinctive and expressive sound.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>The horn is a brass instrument whose soft resonant timbre allows it to harmonize well with both brass and woodwind instruments. One of the unique aspects of this instrument is that the player keeps a hand in the bell while playing. </p>

                    <p>The tuba is the largest and lowest-pitched brass instrument. It has a bell-shaped mouthpiece and a long,
                         coiled tubing that ends in a flared bell. It produces a deep, rich sound that is often used as a bass
                          line in orchestral, band, and jazz music. The tuba comes in several sizes and types, including the contrabass
                           tuba, bass tuba, and sousaphone. It is played by blowing air through the mouthpiece and manipulating the pitch 
                           with valves and slide. Its versatility allows it to play a wide range of musical styles and it can also be used
