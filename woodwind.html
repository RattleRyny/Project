            <p>The timbre of a guitar is determined by its body. Most people have never looked inside a guitar and may not realize it, but guitars are actually very cleverly designed.</p>

                    <h3>What is the acoustic Guitar?</h3>
                    <p>An acoustic guitar is a guitar with a hollow body that amplifies the vibration of the strings acoustically.
                        An acoustic guitar doesn’t require external electronic amplification in order to be comfortably heard.
                        The vibrations of the strings of an acoustic guitar are amplified via the ‘sound box’ (the hollow body of the guitar) and the ‘sound board’ (the front of an acoustic guitar’s body).
                        The term ‘acoustic guitar’ generally refers to a guitar with steel strings.<a href="https://www.guitarcommand.com/what-is-an-acoustic-guitar/#:~:text=An%20acoustic%20guitar%20is%20a,order%20to%20be%20comfortably%20heard." target="_blank">[1]</a></p>

            <hr>
            <p>Whether performing an elegant solo or being the heart of the orchestra, the violin is a “star” in the music world.</p>

                    <h3>What is the violin?</h3>
                    <p>The violin is the smallest and highest-pitched of the instruments in the string family. 
                        It is related to a North African instrument called a rebab (a three-stringed instrument also played with a bow drawn across the strings). 
                        Violins have been traditionally used as an accompaniment to singing and dancing. 
                        It is also an important classical solo instrument, as well as taking pride of place at the front of orchestras.
                        When played, the violin is held under the chin and the fingers of the left hand press the strings on the neck of the instrument to produce different pitches when the string is bowed or plucked. 
                        The bow is held in the right hand and it is drawn across the strings at right angles to make them sound.<a href="https://www.dkfindout.com/uk/music-art-and-literature/musical-instruments/violin/" target="_blank">[3]</a></p>

            <hr>
            <p>The piano is a keyboard instrument that produces sound by striking strings with hammers, characterized by its large range and ability to play chords freely. It is a musical instrument that has broad appeal.</p>
            <div class="ins-info">

                    <h3>What is the piano?</h3>
                    <p>The piano has the widest range of notes of any instrument, covering more than seven octaves. 
                        The word “piano” is short for pianoforte, meaning that the instrument can be played softer (what a musician would call "piano") or
                        louder (known as "forte") in response to the player’s touch on the keyboard. 
                        When a key is pressed on the keyboard, it moves a felt-covered hammer that strikes a steel string, making it vibrate to produce a sound. 
                        The piano is a versatile instrument and is played in all types of music, including classical, popular, and jazz.<a href="https://www.dkfindout.com/uk/music-art-and-literature/musical-instruments/piano/" target="_blank">[4]</a></p>
