            <p>The timpani is an indispensable part of any orchestra, with its heavy bass sound that resonates deep in your abdomen. It is capable of producing accurate pitches, and can even be used to play a melody.</p>

                    <h3>What is the timpani?</h3>
                    <p>The timpani, also known as the kettle drum, is a type of percussion instrument that consists of a
                         large hemispherical drum with a skin or membrane stretched over the top. 
                         The pitch of the timpani can be adjusted by tightening or loosening the tension of the membrane using 
                         a set of pedals or tuning keys. Timpani are commonly used in orchestral and symphonic music to provide
                         rhythmic and harmonic support, as well as for dramatic effect.</p>

                    <p>The xylophone is a percussion instrument consisting of a set of wooden bars of varying lengths that 
                        are arranged in order of pitch. When struck with mallets, the bars produce musical tones that can be 
                        either bright or mellow depending on the type of wood used. The xylophone is commonly used in classical 
                        music and orchestral arrangements, as well as in contemporary music genres such as jazz and popular music. 
                        It is also a popular instrument in marching bands and other types of ensembles.</p>

                    <h3>What is the drums?</h3>
                    <p>Drums are a type of percussion instrument that typically consists of a hollow cylinder with a membrane 
                        or drumhead stretched tightly over one or both ends. The sound of the drums is produced by striking 
                        the drumhead with drumsticks, mallets, or with the hands, causing the membrane to vibrate and produce
                         sound waves. Drums are used in a wide variety of music genres, including rock, pop, jazz,
                          and world music, and can be found in various sizes and shapes. 
                          They provide rhythm and drive to music, and often serve as the backbone of a musical ensemble.</p>

            <p>There are various ingenious ways in which the marimba is designed to produce musical notes, including in places you cannot see, as well as through the length and thickness of the wood.</p>

                    <h3>What is the piano?</h3>
                    <p>The marimba is a percussion instrument that consists of a set of wooden bars of different lengths 
                        that are arranged in order of pitch and mounted over metal resonators. When struck with mallets, 
                        the wooden bars produce musical tones that are similar in sound to a xylophone, but with a richer 
                        and more mellow timbre. The marimba is commonly used in classical music, particularly in orchestral 
                        and chamber music, but it can also be found in jazz, Latin, and contemporary music genres. 
                        The instrument is played either solo or as part of an ensemble and has a range of approximately 
                        four octaves.</a></p>
